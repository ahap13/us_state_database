# us_state_database
Menu-driven U.S. State database program.

Functionality includes displaying all 50 states with their respective capitals, populations, and state flowers.
Another option allows user to search for a specific state and display all of the previous info while also launching a photo of the state flower.
Third option allows the user to display a graph of the top 5 highest populations.
Fourth allows the user to search for a state to update the population.

***Photo filepaths in code are specific to my system and must be adjusted to where the new user stores photos.
